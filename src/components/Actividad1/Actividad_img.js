A typical day for me starts early because I start classes at 7:00 a.m. I never eat breakfast at home, I only drink a cup of coffee. When I’m at university, I eat a hamburger and some soda for lunch. For dinner, I usually eat cookies, a sandwich and soda. I finish my day at 12:00 a.m. On weekends, I normally have lunch before work and I drink cold tea and cookies. When I finish work, I eat pizza or a hot dog. I don’t do much exercise because I don’t like it and I don’t have any free time."
